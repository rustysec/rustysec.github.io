of Rust's killer features is its amazing memory management system via the\nvaunted \"Borrow Checker\".\nWe can use this awesome sauce to enhance the ergonomics and safety of\ninteroperating with other languages, as well!\n\nIn my professional life I spend a lot of time writing Rust code that interfaces\nwith native APIs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.\nWhat this means in practice is that I have to leave the comfortable confines of\nRust and venture into the wild and untamed lands of C and C++.\nFFI with rust is easy to do but can be somewhat tricky to get \"right\".\nForeign Function Interface\nThe Rustonomicon\nhas a great section on FFI with examples on how to call C from Rust and the reverse.\nSo what exactly is FFI? Well, simply put, it is the invocation of code outside\nthe language you are currently working in.\nBecause of this, occasionally memory is allocated by some other language and\nRust is unable to leverage the Borrow Checker directly to free it when necessary.\nHere's an example of calling a C function that allocates memory that we (the\ndeveloper) are now responsible for:\n\nNow this might work fine if the flow of the application is this simple.\nBut what happens in the scenario where you need to pass this\nhandle around or its' lifetime cannot be completely guaranteed?\nForegoing the CloseHandle call will lead to a memory leak and, depending\non your application, could have serious side effects.\nRust to the Rescue\nUnder \"normal\" circumstances, Rust's Borrow Checker can map the lifetime\nof a piece of data at compile time and determine when it must be freed.\nIn the case of this FFI call, that process handle is allocated somewhere\nand we are now responsible for that allocation's maintenance.\nOne really nice and ergonomic way to deal with this is to create a Rust\nwrapper around the FFI type and leverage the languages features to help\nus manage the deallocation.\n\nWe can now pass a HandleWrapper around in place of a HANDLE and be assured\nthat when it goes out of scope the wrapped value will be freed appropriately.\nMinor Optimizations\nWhat if we want to limit the calls to CloseHandle? Our wrapper implements\nClone which means we could end up with many instances of our handle. It\nisn't always optimal to call a close of free function repeatedly, especially\nafter it has already been handled.\nWe can solve this problem in a number of ways. We could use an internal explicit\ncounter, or we can use some extra Rust goodness to help us out.\n\nIf this structure needs to be Send/Sync we can replace some types here with\nthings like Arc\nand even change HANDLE to something like AtomicISize and do some casting\nwhen needed.\nConclusion\nRust is such a great enhancement over other \"systems\" programming language.\nThe safety and security the memory management model provides allows for a\nlot of pain free development. Corner cases like Foreign Function Interfaces\ncan seem daunting at the outset, but any hurdle can end up being cleared\nusing Rust's language features.\n","id":"https://rustysec.github.io/20231101-safe-ffi-rust-memory/","title":"Safe Pointer Management With Rust"},"https://rustysec.github.io/20240306-memory-injection-intro/":{"body":"As security software gets smarter and more effective, finding ways to hide\nfrom it have also evolved. There are a number of methods and tactics employed\nto achieve full memory residence, thus thwarting many detection mechanisms.\nUnderstanding these implementations is essential to developing solutions to the\nproblem.\n\nThe threat of memory resident, or \"file-less\", malware is not at all new.\nFor years actors have used these technologies to evade detection and enhance\nthe effectiveness of ransomware, banking malware, and even toolkits such as\nMetasploit and Cobalt Strike.\nBut how do these things work? Well, in truth, there really is nothing particularly\ncomplicated once one can understand the operating system features and capabilities\nleveraged to employ thees attacks.\nThe Basics\nTo begin, let's look at application code as it is being run. Simplistically we can\nthink of a program a little like this:\n\nNow there is a lot we leave out here in this little diagram, namely things like the stack\nand where certain data is located. There are tables in most executable formats that include\nsymbols, debug information, import and export sections, etc. For now, we don't really need\nto look at these.\nThe magic of memory injection is changing the location of the execution pointer to\nsome custom location housing the code we want to run. This interrupts the actual flow\nof the application and allows the \"attacker\" to hijack the rest of the program's lifetime.\nNow we'll take a look at some simple breakdowns of various techniques to get code loaded into\nan application and alter it's execution.\nPayload\nThroughout the rest of this post, I will reference a \"payload\" to inject. There are a number\nof ways to go about creating one, but a simple and effective method would be to use metasploit\nto produce some message box shellcode (or whatever else you prefer).\nProcess Hollowing\nTo support features like debugging, operating systems enable breakpoints to halt execution\nand inspect the state of the running process. Another fun feature involves the \"state\" of\nan application when it is spawned. In general, when you run a program, it just executed as\na normally running process. There are other states, however, including the SUSPENDED state.\nThis enables the application loader to bring the process code into memory, resolve imports,\nand align all the sections to their proper locations for the application to run. But this is\nwhere it stops. The program is ready to go and the execution pointer is targeting the first\ninstruction location, but it does not proceed with the actual execution.\nThis is where we can get clever. By starting the process in a suspended state and knowing where\nthe code section is located, we can now overwrite the normal functionality of the application\nwith our custom code. This has the fun side effect of the application appearing as though\nit is the legitimate original.\nExample\nNow let us take a peek at what this can look like in actual code. First we need to start by\ncreating a process in a suspended state. I am going to use windows examples, even though\nthis same technique can be applied to Linux and MacOS (the latter requires code signed\nbinaries to access some of the necessary APIs, however).\nLuckily for us, MSDN has some fairly helpful documentation on\nprocess creations\nflags. Most importantly for our purposes:\n\nCREATE_SUSPENDED\n0x00000004\nThe primary thread of the new process is created in a suspended state, and does not run until the ResumeThread function is called.\n\nQuick Disclaimer: much of this code assumes we are dealing with 64 bit processes, in reality we should\naccount for either 32 or 64 bit applications.\n\nAt this point, a notepad.exe process is loaded up and ready for some plain text editing.\nBut we have different plans! This is where things start to get fun. To figure out where to\ninject our shellcode, we really need to find the execution entry point. Luckily for us,\nthe PROCESS_INFORMATION structure contains a handle to the main thread of the loaded process.\nWe can query the information about this thread to retrieve the entry address!\n\nNow the InformationClass parameter for this function call is not officially documented.\nHowever, there are several projects that aim to implement these functions and have provided\ndescriptions, such as\nntinternals.net\nWe have everything we need at this point. We assume the payload is our shellcode stored as a Vec&lt;u8&gt; and:\n\nThe last thing we need to do is resume our process thread:\n\nYou will now see a message box, if you chose to go that route. If you open windows task manager you will also\nsee an instance of notepad.exe running. Viewing the details of the process will show the application appears\ncompletely legitimate and indistinguishable from a \"normal\" instance of the same process.\nDetection\nGenerally speaking, this isn't a conceptually difficult attack to detect. If we have the original\ncode on disk and that in memory, we can compare them for differences. An issue arises due to a\nside effect of the loading process. Programs are compiled with addresses to functions and variables\nat various offsets inside the binary code. A semi-randomization process takes place to adjust these\noffsets when the program is loaded. This does two things: first it adjusts the offsets to their memory\naligned locations since there is often different alignments on disk vs in memory. Secondly, the\nrandomization process (on windows this is referred to as Address Space Layer Randomization, or ASLR)\nis intended to thwart attacks which rely on knowing addresses of code to call, such as a buffer overflow.\nNow knowing this, we can try to resolve these differences in a couple of ways. Finding the first known\naddress and comparing it to the offsets on disk can potentially allow us to compute the ASLR offset.\nAt this point we would need to account for these differences when comparing the disk vs memory code.\nAlternatively we could perform a likeness comparison between the code segments and determine some\nacceptable drift for detecting a hollowing attack.\nThis is even further complicated by technologies like Windows-on-Windows 64, or WOW64, the subsystem\nfor running 32-bit applications on 64-bit windows. This system actually ends up rewriting and shimming\ncode in 32-bit applications which fundamentally changes them making comparison even more difficult.\nInject and Spawn\nThis is a very common technique for running code in a remote process. The basic concept is that some\nexecutable code is written into allocated heap space in a running process. A new thread is then spawned\nin that process with the heap address as the starting location.\nIf you have some ready made shellcode, this process is pretty simple:\n\nOpenProcess()\nVirtualAllocEx()\nWriteProcessMemory()\nCreateRemoteThread()\n\nIf you don't have shellcode and want to execute something like a raw executable file, you will need to\ndo some basic memory management to replicate loader functionality. This will assure any import addresses\nare correctly computed in accordance with ASLR and expected section offset locations.\nDetection\nA common practice for finding injected executables is to look for the headers in places they should not\nbe, such as heap space. This is how malfind in volatility works.\nLocating shellcode running in memory can be tricky, but looking at where current thread start locations\nwill give a hint if the code section of a module or heap space was used.\nDLL Injection\nWhile this process is often referred to as \"DLL Injection\", that name is very\nwindows-centric and it should be noted that this technique applies to any\nshared object format such as .so on linux or .dyld on macos.\nThis process works by causing a running application to load a dynamic library of\nyour choice and run it. This is similar to an \"Inject and Spawn\" attack but instead\nof writing program code we write a string containing the path to the library, and\nthen execute a call to LoadLibrary inside the process using CreateRemoteThread.\nThis attack is helpful for masking the activity of nefarious code inside a trusted\napplication, but it requires the library to be on disk, thus exposing it to possible\ndetection by security products inspecting data at rest.\n\nDetection\nDetecting library injection can be tricky, because it is valid for a running application to dynamically\nload a dependency. In general, an application will maintain an import table that will contain the\nfunctions to use from a dependency. Comparing the current loaded libraries with those referenced in\nthe import table is one naive method for detecting an injection. However, if an application normally\ndynamically loads various libraries, these will not be listed in the import table to begin with, so this\ndetection method falls apart.\nModule Stomping\nThis is a fun mashup between library injection and process hollowing. The basic principals have\nalready been covered. Here we are forcing a process to load a benign library, but before we call\nthe entry function, we will overwrite it with our shellcode (or entire library if we wish).\n\nGet a process handle\nAllocate a string to the path we want to load in the process\nCall LoadLibrary\nOverwrite the entry point function\nCall the entry point function\n\nDetection\nSimilar to process hollowing and module injection, finding stomped modules can be a bit of a chore.\nDetermining if the module belongs in the process (via import table) is one first step (but not without\nits issues as described previously). Enumerating the loaded modules in the process then auditing the\ncode segment with what is on disk is another solution. However, this can face similar relocation problems\nwhen 32bit &lt;-&gt; 64bit translations and patching happen.\nConclusion\nMemory injection is a very interesting and useful technique for concealing execution of code.\nWhile detecting the use of these mechanisms can be tricky, understanding how they work can help\nin demystifying them. The term \"file-less malware\" came into vogue several years ago, but process\ninjection has been a tactic in use for much longer than it has been present in the collective\nconscience of the security industry.\nHopefully these simple demonstrations help someone to understand the basic methodologies for some\npopular memory injection techniques!\n","id":"https://rustysec.github.io/20240306-memory-injection-intro/","title":"Introduction to Memory Injection"},"https://rustysec.github.io/20240610-nix-and-back-again/":{"body":"Linux is great. I love Linux. One of the aspects I love the most is customization and the\nchance to really bend the whole system setup to exactly what I want. Now when I say I love\n\"Linux\" more specifics are needed.\n\nThere are a ton of distributions out there, and for much\nof my time in the linux world (1997-ish until now), many of them have been basically shipping\ntheir own spin on the same thing. The major differences really have come down to package\nmanager, release philosophy, defaults, and theming. When you install most distributions the\nmain learning curve is absorbing the defaults and deciphering the package manager syntax.\nNix(OS) Is Different\nDisclaimer: For the sake of this little write up, I'm not going to distinguish too much between nix the\npackage management system and NixOS the operating system/distribution. I'm also going to\nrephrase a lot of nomenclature and descriptions in a way I feel is more accessible to those\nwho are not already familiar with nix.\nNixOS works on a declarative configuration file that defines your entire system (well, mostly).\nChanges to this file and a subsequent rebuild trigger packages being added and removed from the\nsystem, settings changed, etc. The resulting system is a snapshot known as a generation. This is\nactually a really killer feature, since every generation can be switched between pretty much at\nwill. What this means is that making some wild changes to your system setup are virtually guaranteed\nto not bork it beyond recovery.\nCaveat: A lot of user specific settings are better served being configured through \"Home Manager\",\na user-land system that relies on the nix packager and syntax, but only affects the user home directory.\nHome Manager is well integrated with the nix system, meaning everything can be packaged together in\none configuration file (or set of files) for simplicity or organization.\nNix Is Very Cool\nNix is incredibly powerful and useful, not only in theory or principal, but in practice. It means\none configuration file can be pulled on to any number of systems and in minutes (literally) you have\nidentical setups with all your tools configured exactly the same.\nThe integration in configuration of applications is actually astonishing. The amount of work that has\nbeen invested in nix and home manager is a triumph of open source. Using a nix language server you\ncan get configuration completion and type checking for tools like zsh and neovim (and gazillions more).\nIn my experience, this makes configuration options really discoverable, and resources like\nmynixos are incredibly helpful.\nHome Manager with nixvim is my single favorite neovim package\nmanager I have ever used. (I'll cover more on that in a later post.)\nNix Is Very Hard\nI'm going to point out some friction points I have encountered while running NixOS across several systems\nover 6 or so months. Of course, this is all just my experience and Is not meant to be overly negative toward\nnix or NixOS.\nSyntax\nI don't think any discussion about nix or nixos can be complete without discussing the syntax. This is a\nsimple file, and perhaps it is not a great example of complexity, but it does demonstrate some basic syntax:\n\nThe real highlight is the functional purity of inputs and outputs. If you aren't familiar with functional\nprogramming principals at the start, getting syntax and functionality correct will be a steep climb. I think\nmost experienced \"Linux People\" are used to doing things \"the Linux way\", mostly involving scripting languages\nor familiar configuration files. Nix, in large part, is a departure from this.\nDocs Are... Where are the docs?\nWhile there are some really good documentation resources, there are also enormous gaps. The modus operandi of the\ncommunity is to scour github (or whatever) for examples of other configurations that \"get close\" to what you\nare trying to do, and go from there. This suddenly feels like the old joke that no one has ever written a Makefile\nfrom scratch, except the very first one.\nWhile, generally speaking, this seems to work out pretty well, I have found myself completely unable to figure out\nhow to do something with very few resources to fall back on.\nThere Is No \"Right Way\"\nIn true Linux/Unix fashion, there isn't just one way to do anything. There are these things called flakes, you\nshould use them! But also, you might not need them. They are really powerful and let you extend the capabilities\nof nix. However, if you are sticking to the happy path on software and settings, it is another layer of complexity.\nYou can have home manager or nix download and package things, clone from git, fetch with http or ftp, etc. Which\nis the right method is sometimes mystifying and trial-and-error is your only solution.\nDeveloping Is Great, But Also Harder\nI write code all day long, and nix has some incredible tools to set up and maintain multiple development environments\nthat can be used for different projects. There are dev shells, nix environments, and the aforementioned flakes. Which\nof these is the right tool for the job takes some experience to understand.\nFor example, if you are trying to compile some code which needs the openssl development libraries, you cannot install\nthese on the base nixos, by design. This has to do with reproducibility and the generations I mentioned earlier, versioning\nall of that would be quite difficult. What this means is that we need a development environment to provide the necessary\nfiles to get this done. There are a couple of ways to do this:\nWith nix-env:\n\nwill drop you right into a shell in your current directory that now has the openssl development files available. If they\nwere not present before, they will be downloaded and stored.\nYou can also use flakes:\n\nIsn't that clear as day? Now flakes allow you to do all kinds of neat things, like you can build the entire dev environment\nin the flake.nix file in your repository, and then when someone clones they can get your exact toolchain versions so you\nare guaranteed things will work.\nWhere this comes off the rails a bit for me is when I need to do something kind of bonkers... like cross compiling from linux\nto macos, there is not a built in toolchain solution in nixos for that, so I would end up using cross-rs\nlike I do everywhere else, somewhat missing out on some nix-y goodness. When I start reaching for other tooling outside the nix\necosystem it starts to feel a little more hacky and I start wonder if I'm doing it \"wrong\".\nWhat generally happens is that 50 times a day I completely forget to enter a dev shell and open neovim to do some work and suddenly\nLSP features are not working because there is no openssl on the base system and Cargo decided it could not compile and process\nthe project.\nIs this a nix problem? Absolutely not. This is a me problem.\nAnd That's The Issue\nNix is awesome, all the principals are amazing and it has even got me out of some binds. But... and this is an important but...\nIt introduces a lot of cognitive overhead when you are trying to add things to your workflow. It is such a unique departure from\nall I know about Linux-ing that everything feels fresh and new mixed with scary and uncertain.\nSometimes I don't even know where to start looking for answers, and instead of being able to solve the problem with man pages or\napplying some acquired past knowledge, I'm just starting from zero. And that, to me, feels like too much work.\nAll of these feelings are my feelings and don't speak to some objective truth about Nix or NixOS. It just simply means that at this moment\nin time I don't have the brain power to embrace this new way of doing everything.\nSo What's Linux Nerd To Do?\nWell my first plan was to just jump to another distro and continue using Home Manager to port my configurations around. However,\nHM still requires a working Nix installation and I immediately ran into all kinds of local conflicts when I attempted to set it up\non a Void machine. Neovim was freaking out and things were just total chaos. In an unrelated endeavour, I had home manager running\non my Macbook and something caused that installation to break within 24 hours of my other issues and it all just felt like a sign.\nI decided to spend an evening or two ripping my configurations out of home manager and going back to the old dotfiles repo. I also\nstarted writing some setup and install scripts for my common used distros (Void, Tumbleweed, and Debian) to recreate the Nix+HM\nexperience.\nIs it the same? Not at all. Is it messy and dirty and gross? Of course. Is it Wonderful in its own Linux way? You bet.\nAnd All This Means...?\nNothing, really. I gave NixOS a lot of run and it just didn't seem like the right fit for me at this point in my life. I have too\nmany other responsibilities and Nix felt like I was going back to school. That being said, I do firmly believe that some sort of system\nlike nix is probably the Linux of the future. I am not at all certain if that Future Linux is nix in the current form. With projects\nlike Fedora Silverblue and OpenSuse MicroOS, the idea of atomic, reproducible, immutable, etc etc is starting to take hold. All of these\nprojects have differences, but at their core it feels like we are all searching for a way to configure our systems in a sane and efficient\nmanner. Seeing which of these ultimately wins the hearts and minds of users should be fascinating.\nThere is so much amazing work that has gone into the nix ecosystem that I am sure it will thrive for a long time. I continue to have my\neye on the nix world and track what is happening, but over here, I'm just rocking a traditional Linux environment.\n","id":"https://rustysec.github.io/20240610-nix-and-back-again/","title":"NixOS and Back Again"},"https://rustysec.github.io/20240626-atomic-fedora-with-niri/":{"body":"Atomic linux distributions promise a lot for the future of the operating system.\nSecurity, stability, ease up updates, testability, reproducibility, etc. These\nprojects achieve these benefits by reducing the churn on the base system and nudging\nthe user towards more sanboxed solutions for their apps. An oft perceived downside\nof this architecture is limited customization options.\n\nI wrote a post about my journey with Nix and thought it\nwould be a fun adventure to explore some other non-traditional Linux environments. This\nalso coincides with my adoption of an awesome new window manager project, Niri!\nUpdate 2024-10-17\nWhile this was a fun adventure, it turns out there is a Niri COPR now!\n\nQuick Foundational Aside\nBefore getting too far, I want to touch on what exactly an atomic system is.\nIn the most simple of terms, we can think of an atomic OS as one in which the entire\nsystem is maintained as one \"image\", or \"generation\", or \"layer\"... Whatever mental model\nworks for you. When an update happens, the entire image is laid down to replace the last one.\nGenerally, this happens in an A-B model where the new base is laid down next to the old,\nand you switch into it after a reboot. This allows everything to be replaced at once,\neliminating any conflicts (looking at you, python), while also facilitating rollbacks.\nNow, I don't mean to confuse anyone with these terms as they actually have\nmeaning depending on what distribution you are using, I'm not using any specific system's\nterminology here, just a purely vendor-agnostic description.\nSo how does this play out in real life? Well (generally) you have a base layer that is\nplaced on the system. This is all the packages and files needed to make the system start up\nand give you the desired experience. In the case of\nFedora Silverblue\nor\nOpenSUSE AEON\nthis essentially boils down to a base Gnome experience with packages and configurations to\ndeliver a nice and usable system for the end user.\nDisclaimer: Fedora-isms incoming\n\"What about MyFavoriteApp???\" you ask? Well that's where solutions like Flatpak\ncome into play. This allows a platform independent mechanism for installing, updating, and\nlaunching apps. Containerized apps don't rely on system dependencies, thus they can be used\nfreely with a very minimal set of actual packages installed.\n\"But I need my developer tools!!!\" you say? Toolbox has your back. Just toolbox enter and boom,\nyou have a mutable containerized shell where you can install anything you want and it is well\nintegrated with your home directory and desktop environment.\nCustomization\nOf course not everything you need to customize your experience can be handled through flatpak and\ntoolbox (or distrobox, if you're using something other than fedora).\nEnter the layers!\nAtomic systems provide the ability to extend the base image by adding layers. What this means is that\nwhen you perform an update, the base image is rolled out and whatever additional layers you have\nchosen are then applied on top. This helps maintain the integrity of the system and gives you an \"as\nfresh as possible\" experience on each generation of your system.\nNiri Setup\nNow that we have the basics in place, it's time to make this thing our own.\nNiri is a scrolling, tiling, very awesome wayland compositor, so to start this adventure I chose to\nroll out the Fedora Sericea or \"Sway Atomic\" image.\nThis has a lot of the minimal configs and packages you would expect from a window manager.\nThe install essentially proceeds as any other Fedora install, and in the end we end up in a pretty basic\nsway environment.\nNext I decided to layer in some system level tools that I need:\n\nI keep my dotfiles in github and have a script that links them all to the appropriate XDG folders,\nand that process doesn't change at all.\nSo now I need to actually compile Niri, and we don't want to install all that tooling on the base system\n(the more layers the more pollution, and the longer updates will take).\n\nOnce inside toolbox, we can get down to business:\nInstall all the prerequisites:\n\nBuild Niri:\n\nOnce built, we need to drop out of toolbox to continue installation. Toolbox is sandboxed\naway from your main running system so it only has access to the home directory.\nHere we have to make some minor changes to the install instructions, since the base OS is technically\n\"immutable\", we have to use the alternate directories which are then merged during boot:\n\nEdit 2024-07-23: Fixed the files/folder names above. Additionally, the paths in some of these files will\nneed to be updated to reflect the atomic directory structure. For example, /usr/bin/niri-session becomes\n/usr/local/bin/niri-session.\nBy default, Sericea/Sway Atomic uses SDDM, when you restart the system you will now be able to\nchoose \"Niri\" as your session and voila, magic.\nPod-ception\nOne last bit of developer setup I needed to work around is my use of cross-rs\nfor cross compilation. This requires access to podman (or docker) so it can orchestrate building\nand running container workloads. It also requires rust tooling to be available which, if you remember\nfrom earlier, we installed via rustup so the binaries are in the home directory, totally accessible to\nboth the toolbox and system environments.\nMy solution here was to enable the podman socket activation in the OS:\n\nThen install podman-remote inside toolbox:\n\nNow this allows me to build my cross containers inside toolbox with no issues.\nThere you have it\nThat wasn't so hard, right? Now you have a super simple and stable base OS complete with atomic\nupdating and rollbacks. The only minor diversion here is that we wanted a hot-off-the-presses\ncompositor/window manager without using a supported layer.\nI think this goes to show that customization and atomic being mutually exclusive is almost entirely\na myth. The facts are that it is different than a traditional environment, but most definitely\nnot incompatible.\n","id":"https://rustysec.github.io/20240626-atomic-fedora-with-niri/","title":"Atomic Fedora with Niri"},"https://rustysec.github.io/20250321-closing-a-chapter/":{"body":"Almost exactly eleven years ago my good friend and I sat on the couch with\nmy very pregnant wife and convinced her that we were going to quit our very stable\njobs to start a company, and that this was a good idea.\n\nThis conversation went about as well as you might expect, but after a lot of questions\nand assurances everyone was on board.\nBoth he and I had spent our careers to this point in the military.\nAfter meeting through our work as part of the US Air Force's cyber defense mission we eventually ended up\npartnered together training groups of airmen who would go on to be enterprise threat hunters.\nThrough this experience we had developed a strong conviction about missing components in\nthe status quo security posture advocated by cyber security professionals and implemented around the world.\nWe decided to bring automated threat hunting tools to the private sector and this was impetus for Infocyte, Inc.\nWe spent a few months building new tools to deliver threat hunting-as-a-service to our\npotential customers. To our surprise, we actually had customers! We were able to leverage\nour new product to help companies respond to ongoing attacks. We felt incredible, as you\nmight guess.\nShortly after these early successes and some local news coverage, we were approached by a\nventure capital firm and encourage to take our in-house tools and turn them into a software\nproduct that could be sold, instead of used as part of a service.\nThis was a great idea, save one small detail: we had no idea how to be a software company.\nAfter many ups and downs and, we started assembling a solid team to help us build\nthe product.
